# Intro Labs: Delegated Authorization using OAuth 2.0

The intro labs contain the following demos:

* [Authorization Grant Requests](oauth-grants)  
  In this intro lab you will use _curl_, _httpie_ or _postman_ to create
  the OAuth 2.0 requests to get access tokens.
* [Authorization Code Grant Flow Demo](auth-code-demo)  
  This one shows all steps of the authorization code grant flow
  in detail to understand how this flow works. This is important for other concepts
  that are built upon this flow like the PKCE addition or OpenID Connect.
